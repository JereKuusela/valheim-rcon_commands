# Rcon Commands

Allows executing commands on the server with RCON.

Install on the server (modding [guide](https://youtu.be/WfvA5a5tNHo)).

Install also [rcon](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/AviiNL/rcon/) and check its documentation.

## Usage

All rcon clients didn't seem to work. Here is one that works: <https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/rcon-client.79413/>.

If you can find others would be nice to know so I can add to the readme.

## Credits

Thanks for Azumatt for creating the mod icon!
